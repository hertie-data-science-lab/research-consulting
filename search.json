We primarily focus on questions of research design, quantitative measurement and statistical inference, computational tools (particularly R and text analysis), and data visualization.\nWe offer individual consultations and workshops for graduate students and researchers at the Hertie School and the SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence. As of March 2020, we have been operating our consultations and workshops fully online.\nWho?\nWe are Olga Gasparyan, PhD, Dr. Will Lowe, Allison Koh, and Lisa Oswald. We particularly like to help with:\nOlga: Linear Models and data visualization in R (including maps), research design and causal inference, basic survey and experiments questions, data management in R and Python, basic Python questions, web scrapping in Python (including Selenium), Latex, basic ML consulting.\nDr. Lowe: Research design, causal inference, statistical modeling; data wrangling, visualization, text analysis (statistical or manual), GIS (maps), code optimization and parallel computing, all in R. Basic python consulting.\nAllison: Learning R and RStudio. Data wrangling, visualization, and working with text data in R and Python. Statistical computing in Stata.\nLisa: Statistics in R, research design, data wrangling using R and Python, working with APIs / accessing data in Python, Network Analysis in Python, Agent based modelling in Netlogo, LaTeX\nHow?\nConsultations\nIf you are a student or researcher at the Hertie School, book an appointment on Moodle.\nIf you are a researcher with SCRIPTS, fill out the consultation request form.\nWorkshops\nAll graduate students, researchers, and affiliates of the Hertie School and the SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence will be notified of upcoming workshops via email.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nSCRIPTS Researchers\nIf you are a researcher affiliated with SCRIPTS, fill out the consultation request form to request an appointment with a research consultant. After you submit the form, a research consultant will reach out via email to schedule an appointment.\nEmail consulting is also available for questions that do not require a scheduled meeting.\nHertie School Students and Researchers\nIf you are a student or researcher at the Hertie School, book an appointment on Moodle. In the event that there are technical issues, feel free to reach out to us via email.\nOnce you book an appointment, a research consultant will send you an invitation to join a Microsoft Teams meeting via email. The research consultant may also request additional information about your issue to prepare for the meeting.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nNOTE: Questions specific to the Hertie community can be found on Moodle.\nWhich resources do you recommend for learning R?\nThere are plenty of resources for learning R that are freely available online, such as:\nRStudio Primers\nSTAT 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R (Jenny Bryan)\nSTA 199: Intro to data science (Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel)\nData science in a box (RStudio)\nHands-On Programming with R (Garrett Grolemund)\nRStudio Education’s list of resources for Beginners\nWill you help me with specific questions about my dissertation or research?\nWe are happy to help with the implementation of methodological approaches suggested by your supervisor, PI, or professor. While research consultants might have an idea of which empirical strategies fit your research, specific advice about methods should come from your supervisor. Once you have an idea of which approaches you would like to implement, we can advise on which statistical packages might get you there and what resources are available for learning about a particular method.\nHow should I expect to work with my research consultant after an initial meeting has taken place?\nResearch consultants can follow up with advice and assistance on projects via email consulting and follow-up appointments. Regardless of the arrangement you and your consultant decide upon, please note that the research consultant cannot write original code or text for your thesis or research.\nCollaborations with your research consultants beyond initial consultations and general inquiries would be a separate arrangement outside the remit of research consulting services.\nWill you help me with my coursework?\nWe may not be the best for assisting with coursework, as we are not familiar with the expectations of your professors or TAs. We suggest you first ask them about any data issues related to your coursework.\nWill you fix my computer?\nIf you are having a problem with research software, we will certainly try. For example, we specialize in fixing R-related problems and can often deal with python setup. However, for general computing problems and Windows-specific issues you should make an appointment with your respective IT department. If you’re not sure which sort of problem you are up against, ask us anyway!\nI’ve already got my data. Can you help me wrestle it into the right shape?\nDefinitely. We enjoy that sort of thing.\nI would like to provide feedback on my research consulting experience. Who can I reach out to?\nFor questions or remarks related to your research consulting experience, or if you are having difficulty reaching out to your research consultant, please contact Will Lowe via email.\nI am a Professor/PI seeking out support for a larger research project. Can you help me?\nFor questions related to research support on larger projects, please reach out via email to Slava Jankin.\n\n\n\n",
